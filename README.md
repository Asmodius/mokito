# mokito
An asynchronous driver and toolkit for accessing MongoDB in Tornado

## What is mokito?
(MOngodb + [mongoKIt](https://github.com/namlook/mongokit) + TOrnado) is an asynchronous toolkit for working with ``mongodb`` inside a ``tornado`` app, like ``mongokit``. Mokito has a pure implementation of python + tornado and only depends on tornado and bson (provided by pymongo)

## Why not pymongo?
[PyMongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/) is the recommended way to work with MongoDB in Python, but isn't asynchronous and not run inside tornado's IOLoop. If you use pymongo you won't take the advantages of tornado.

## Why not motor?
[Motor](http://emptysquare.net/motor/) wraps PyMongo and makes it async with greenlet. This is a great project, but it uses greenlet. If you can use greenlets why not use gevent instead of tornado? PyMongo already works with gevent. If you are using a very powerfull non-blocking web server with a pure python code, you'll probably want to work with a pure tornado driver for accessing mongo.

## Features
* validation and conversion of data to the specified type
* support for unstructured data
* dot notation
* control over data presentation
* control over data validation
* mapping onto the same document of models with different schemes

## Installing
```bash
pip install pymomgo tornado
pip install mokito
```

## Simple usage
```python
from tornado.web import RequestHandler
from tornado.gen import coroutine

import mokito


class MainHandler(RequestHandler):

    def initialize(self):
        self.db = mokito.Client("db_name", "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017")

    @gen.coroutine
    def get(self, user_id):
        user = yield self.db.user.find_one(user_id)
        self.render("index.html", user=user)
```

## Using ORM
A Document declaration look as follows:

```python
from mokito import Document

class BlogPost(Document):
    fields = {
        'title':str,
        'body':str,
        'author':str
    }

blogpost = BlogPost(title='my title', body='a body', author='unknown', foo='bar')
blogpost['author'] = 'me'
yield blogpost.save()
```
MongoDB in the collection "blog_post" will write this document:
```javascript
{"_id": ObjectId("..."), "body": "a body", "author": "me", "title": "my title"}
```
The field "foo" will not be saved. More about this you can read in [wiki](https://github.com/asmodius/mokito/wiki).

And you can use a more complex structure as follows:
```python
class ComplexDoc(Document):
    __uri__ = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017"
    __database__ = 'test'
    __collection__ = 'example'

    fields = {
        "f_1": None,
        "f_2": int,
        "f_3": float,
        "f_4": dict,
        "f_5": [str],
        "f_6": (int, str),
        "f_7": {
            "x_1": {'a': int, 'b': datetime.datetime},
            "x_2": None,
            "x_3": list
        }
    }
```
